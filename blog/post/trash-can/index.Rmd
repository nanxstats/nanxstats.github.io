I have posted exclusively technical content on this blog for the past five years.
Today, I want to write something different.

I have been using a 45-liter step trash can with a soft-close lid in the kitchen.
Most of it is plastic. The step mechanism broke a few months ago.
I bought the replacement parts and fixed it myself.
Unfortunately, it broke again a few weeks later.

After quoting ["that's trash!"
](https://www.reddit.com/r/AbbottElementary/comments/1d3gkwu/does_anyone_else_find_themselves_accidentally/)
from Mr. Johnson of the show _Abbott Elementary_ in my head
hundreds of times, I finally decided to buy a new trash can.

So I asked Claude the recycling guidelines of this bulky plastic item in
Pennsylvania. After some research and thinking, Claude suggested that I should
put the broken trash can in the regular trash, not recycling.

A light bulb went off in my head. I followed up:

> A trash can thrown in a trash can - isn't that hilarious?

Claude responded:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
@font-face {
    font-display: swap;
    font-family: "PT Serif";
    src: url("PTSerif-Regular.woff2") format("woff2");
    font-weight: 400;
}

blockquote {
  font-family: "PT Serif", serif;
  font-size: 17px;
  letter-spacing: -0.1px;
  background-color: #f8fafc;
  border-left: 1px solid #90a1b9 !important;
  padding-top: 1rem !important;
  padding-bottom: 1rem !important;
}

blockquote p {
  line-height: 1.5 !important;
  margin-top: 0.65rem !important;
  margin-bottom: 0.65rem !important;
  padding-left: 0.5rem !important;
  padding-right: 0.5rem !important;
}
```

The trash can has become the trashed can.

You're absolutely right.
