Although I am not an expert in Bayesian statistics, I always have an idealized version of the framework for Bayesian modeling in my mind:

- Allows defining data models intuitively --- preferably in native R.
- Handles the low-level computations such as MCMC automatically.
- Works on both CPU and GPU seamlessly would be perfect for 2020.

All these features would help me focus on the task instead of the tool better. Among others, [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) and [Edward](http://edwardlib.org/) were pretty close to achieving these goals.

Created by Professor Nick Golding, [greta](https://greta-stats.org/) is now my all-time favorite. It has all the traits described above. You can see this from its [example models](https://greta-stats.org/articles/example_models.html). To know it better, I experimented with it a bit for fitting Bayesian sparse regression models. I soon realized the simplicity provided by greta could truly enable fast exploration of modeling strategies for a range of problems.

## Generate synthetic data

Under the linear model $y = X \beta + \varepsilon$, we will generate 1000 samples: use 500 for fitting the model and leave the rest 500 as the independent test set. The first 10 variables in the total 1000 variables have a non-zero coefficient. A moderate correlation exists between variables. The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is also moderate. We simulate the data with [msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/):

```r
library("msaenet")

n <- 500
p <- 1000
pnz <- 10

dat <- msaenet.sim.gaussian(
  n = n * 2, p = p,
  rho = 0.5, coef = rep(5, pnz), snr = 3,
  p.train = 0.5, seed = 42
)

x <- dat$x.tr
y <- dat$y.tr
beta <- c(rep(5, pnz), rep(0, p - pnz))
```

Note: this is for illustrating the modeling processes only. It is not a comprehensive benchmark in any way. Under many other settings and parameter tuning methods, the results can be very different.

## Multi-step adaptive elastic-net

Let's fit a msaenet model to check if things work, since it offers a look into a pool of models with $\ell_1$ + $\ell_2$ regularizations:

```r
fit_msaenet <- msaenet(
  x, y,
  family = "gaussian",
  init = "ridge", alphas = seq(0.05, 0.95, 0.05),
  tune = "cv", nfolds = 10, rule = "lambda.min",
  nsteps = 20, tune.nsteps = "ebic"
)
```

We achieved the lowest EBIC in step 2, which is equivalent to an adaptive elastic-net model. We selected 36 variables in total: all the 10 true variables and 26 false positive variables. The MSE is 203.

## Lasso

Fit an ordinary lasso model with glmnet:

```r
library("glmnet")

cv_lasso <- cv.glmnet(x, y, family = "gaussian", alpha = 1, nfolds = 10)
fit_lasso <- glmnet(x, y, family = "gaussian", alpha = 1, lambda = cv_lasso$lambda.min)
```

The model selected 56 variables in total: all the 10 true variables and 46 false positive variables. The MSE is 202.

## Bayesian Lasso

Define a Bayesian lasso model using the Laplace prior in greta:

```r
library("greta")

intercept <- normal(0, 10)
sd <- cauchy(0, 3, truncation = c(0, Inf))
coefs <- laplace(0, 1, dim = ncol(x))
mu <- intercept + x %*% coefs
distribution(y) <- normal(mu, sd)

m <- model(intercept, coefs, sd)

draws_blasso <- mcmc(m, warmup = 1000, n_samples = 5000, chains = 8)
```

The computational graph by plotting `m`:

Plot the posterior mean and 95% credible interval of the coefficients:

![Posterior of the coefficients from Bayesian lasso. We check whether the 95% credible interval covers 0 to determine if a variable is selected.](greta-bayesian-lasso-coef.png)

The model selected 16 variables: all the 10 true variables with 6 false positive variables. The MSE is 217.

For more theoretical discussions and empirical comparisons on Bayesian sparse shrinkage in regression, I find the notes from [Jeffrey Arnold](https://jrnold.github.io/bayesian_notes/shrinkage-and-regularized-regression.html) and [Michael Betancourt](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/bayes_sparse_regression.html) useful. To me, it is still a bit magical how intuitively the lasso and Bayesian lasso are connected. I like this type of connection.

## Summary

All three methods correctly selected all the true variables (TP). Regarding the number of false positive variables (FP) and MSE:

- msaenet: moderate MSE close to Lasso; moderate FP
- Lasso: smallest MSE close to msaenet; largest FP
- Bayesian lasso: largest MSE (not too bad though); smallest FP

I would not read into this result too much as it only shows a small facet of the possible modeling approaches. It does demonstrate Bayesian Lasso's potential and the flexibility of greta in probabilistic modeling. I would also try the more recent methods such as [L0Learn](https://github.com/hazimehh/L0Learn) and [susieR](https://github.com/stephenslab/susieR) in any real tasks as they offer some modern understanding of the problem.

By changing the cross-validation $\lambda$ selection rule from `lambda.min` to `lambda.1se` in msaenet and lasso, you will be able to get models with 10 TP variables, 0 FP variables, and an even smaller MSE. It is not used above because I think the rule might introduce an extra "prior" in the Bayesian sense, thus not creating a fair comparison. Similarly, the Bayesian lasso model parameters can also be further tuned, including the priors and variable selection criteria.

I would love to hear your feedback. Please leave a note if you find me made a mistake somewhere or have some suggestions.
