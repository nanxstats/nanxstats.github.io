I constantly feel lucky to witness the growth of _the_ R web framework,
Shiny, in the past ten years.
In his keynote speech at rstudio::conf 2022, Joe Cheng shared an excellent
summary of Shiny's achievements and exciting outlook.

I am deeply moved by the story about how Shiny was created and Joe's journey,
and I recommend you watch the talk recording below if you haven't.
Notably, after Hadley's [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/basic-ui.html) book,
the community-maintained awesome list
[awesome-shiny-extensions](https://github.com/nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions)
was again highlighted in Joe's talk from 24:00 to 24:33
(thanks so much for the shout-out!).
