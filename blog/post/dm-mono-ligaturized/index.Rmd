  Add a sprinkle of Fira Code ligatures to DM Mono for a unique terminal experience.
---

I've created a ligaturized version of [DM Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Mono)
by adding [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) ligatures.
You can download it from GitHub: <https://github.com/nanxstats/dm-mono-ligaturized>.

```{css, echo=FALSE}
@font-face {
    font-display: swap;
    font-family: "Liga DM Mono Regular";
    src: url("fonts/LigaDMMono-Regular.woff2") format("woff2");
    font-weight: 400;
}

}

}

## Why ligatures?

I'll confess: I can't start real work until I've found a coding font
that fits the vibe of the day.
My [dotfiles](https://github.com/nanxstats/dotfiles) are fairly basic,
but they include an extensive list of free and commercial monospaced fonts
that I rotate through regularly.

After years of font-hopping, things started to feel stale.
So I decided to create something new by modifying a less commonly modified
monospaced font: DM Mono, designed by Colophon Foundry for DeepMind
(now Google DeepMind).

If you're wondering whether ligatures are worth the trouble,
I wrote about this in a [previous post](
https://nanx.me/blog/post/gpt-models-font-ligatures/)
exploring how ligatures can improve readability when working with
special tokens in GPT models.
The short version: ligatures reduce cognitive load by rendering
multi-character sequences as single, visually distinct glyphs.

## How it works

Thanks to [ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer](https://github.com/ToxicFrog/Ligaturizer),
a collection of FontForge scripts written in Python, patching fonts with
Fira Code ligatures is surprisingly straightforward.

The build process is wrapped in a [Makefile](
https://github.com/nanxstats/dm-mono-ligaturized/blob/main/Makefile).
The result is six font files covering light, regular, and medium weights,
each with an italic variant.
As usual, it's licensed under the SIL Open Font License.

## What makes DM Mono special

DM Mono has some distinctive design choices that I wanted to highlight.
In my opinion, these glyphs are what give DM Mono its character:

<div class="font-liga-dm-mono">

```text
0 ? @ [ ] f i j k l r t y
```

</div>

After patching, you get these common ligatures from Fira Code,
frequently used in Python, R, Rust, TypeScript, and the command line:

<div class="font-liga-dm-mono">

```text
<- -> => ==> |> :: :::
== != >= <= === || //
```

</div>

For comparison, here's vanilla DM Mono without ligatures:

<div class="font-liga-dm-mono-nolig">

```text
<- -> => ==> |> :: :::
== != >= <= === || //
```

</div>

## Opinionated defaults

Not all Fira Code ligatures fit DM Mono's aesthetic.
These sequences either have quirky ligatures in Fira Code that feel out of place,
or can be easily triggered under the wrong context, so I've disabled them.
They render as individual DM Mono characters instead, as shown below:

<div class="font-liga-dm-mono">

```text
&& ~@ \/ .? ?: ?= ?. ?? ;; /\
```

</div>

If you disagree with these choices, the Makefile makes it easy to adjust.
The ligature configuration is filtered using awk, so adding back or
removing more ligatures is just a matter of editing a few lines.

## Setting it up

Install the fonts from the `fonts/` directory using your OS font manager.
For VS Code and its forks, add this to your `settings.json`:

```json
"editor.fontFamily": "'Liga DM Mono', monospace",
"editor.fontLigatures": "'calt', 'liga'",
"terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'Liga DM Mono', monospace",
"terminal.integrated.fontLigatures.enabled": true,
```

For Ghostty, set the font family in your config:

```text
font-family = Liga DM Mono
```

## When to use it

I find this ligaturized DM Mono works particularly well for terminal use.
For editors, I'm currently switching between TheSansMono (for long-form writing)
and JetBrains Mono/Twilio Sans Mono (for code). But your mileage may vary.
The only way to know is to try everything and see what works for you.
