  Learn how to prompt large language models with complete R package source code
  using pkglite. pkglite automates the process of converting R packages
  to plain text files, making it easier to provide accurate context
  for coding questions and minimize hallucination problems in LLM responses.
  This post demonstrates how pkglite, originally designed for regulatory
  submissions, can be leveraged for effective prompt engineering.

Sometimes, large language models (LLMs) answer coding questions by
making up software behaviors or APIs that don't exist.
A simple but effective strategy to minimize such hallucination problems is to
feed the exact, complete source code as context in the prompt.
For code organized in R packages, it is tedious to copy the file contents
and construct them into prompts manually.
Fortunately, you can use [pkglite](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/)
to automate this process.

pkglite was originally [designed](https://nanx.me/blog/post/ectd-pkglite-paper/)
to convert R packages to plain text files for regulatory submissions.
Here is a minimal example that shows how it can also help prompting LLMs
with the full source code of R packages.

```r
library(pkglite)

# Download and extract package source tarball
url <- "https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/ggsci_3.0.3.tar.gz"
tarball <- tempfile(fileext = ".tar.gz")

curl::curl_download(url, destfile = tarball)
untar(tarball, exdir = tempdir())

# Set source package and output text file paths
pkg <- file.path(tempdir(), "ggsci")
txt <- tempfile(fileext = ".txt")

# Collate all source files under `R/` and `vignettes/`,
# exclude binary files and CSS files, and pack into a `.txt` file.
pkg |>
  collate(file_r(), file_vignettes()) |>
  prune(path = c("R/sysdata.rda", "vignettes/custom.css")) |>
  pack(output = txt)

# Read the `.txt` file and remove the metadata lines
pkg_content <- readLines(txt)[-c(1:3)]

# Estimate # of tokens (1 token ~= 4 chars in English)
sum(nchar(pkg_content)) / 4
```

In essence, three lines of code... is all you need.
For regular users, you can open the txt file and copy the content into the
chat application.
If too long, you can also split the file into multiple chunks and
send it in multiple prompts.

For developers, you can send it via the LLM vendor's API. Example:

```r
library(gptstudio)

# Configure API key first
# <https://github.com/MichelNivard/gptstudio#configuring-openai-api-key>

prompt <- paste0(
  "Act as a senior R software engineer. ",
  "Below is the R package source for ggsci ",
  "in DCF (Debian Control File) format with the file path and content. ",
  "Based on the code and documentation, ",
  "build a custom discrete ggplot2 color scale that implements the ",
  "Bootstrap 5 color palette and allows custom color ordering.\n\n",
  paste0(pkg_content, collapse = "\n")
)

result <- chat(
  prompt,
  service = "openai",
  model = "gpt-4-turbo-preview",
  skill = "advanced",
  task = "coding"
)

cat(result)
```

```{css, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}

````text
To create a custom discrete ggplot2 color scale that implements the Bootstrap 5
color palette and allows for custom color ordering based on the `ggsci` DCF
description and codebase, we can follow a similar pattern to the existing
discrete scales in `ggsci`. Bootstrap 5 provides a set of color palettes
primarily intended for web development, including colors like primary,
secondary, success, danger, warning, info, light, and dark.

Assuming we'd like to incorporate these colors directly from Bootstrap 5 into
a ggplot2 scale, we first need to define the Bootstrap 5 color codes.
For simplicity, let's stick to a subset: primary, danger, and success.
Bootstrap 5 color codes (at the time of my last knowledge update) are
as follows (assuming standard Bootstrap theme colors):

```r
bootstrap5_colors <- c(
  "primary" = "#0d6efd",
  "danger" = "#dc3545",
  "success" = "#198754"
)
```

Now, we'll create a function that generates a custom palette function
incorporating Bootstrap 5 colors and allows for color reordering.
This function will be modelled after the structure of palette functions
provided in the `ggsci` package, for example, `pal_aaas()`, `pal_d3()`, etc.

```r
pal_bootstrap5 <- function(palette = "default", n = 3, alpha = 1, reverse = FALSE) {
  if(alpha <= 0 | alpha > 1) stop("alpha must be in (0, 1]")

  colors <- bootstrap5_colors
  if(palette != "default") {
    stop("Currently, only 'default' palette is implemented.")
  }

  if(reverse) {
    colors <- rev(colors)
  }

  if (length(colors) > n) {
    colors <- colors[seq_len(n)]
  }

  # Applying alpha transparency
  colors <- grDevices::adjustcolor(colors, alpha.f = alpha)

  unname(colors)
}
```

Next, we create the `scale_color_` and `scale_fill_` functions to incorporate
these colors into ggplot2 plots.

```r
scale_color_bootstrap5 <- function(..., palette = "default", reverse = FALSE, alpha = 1) {
  discrete_scale(
    aesthetics = "colour",
    scale_name = "bootstrap5",
    palette = pal_bootstrap5(palette = palette, alpha = alpha, reverse = reverse),
    ...
  )
}

scale_fill_bootstrap5 <- function(..., palette = "default", reverse = FALSE, alpha = 1) {
  discrete_scale(
    aesthetics = "fill",
    scale_name = "bootstrap5",
    palette = pal_bootstrap5(palette = palette, alpha = alpha, reverse = reverse),
    ...
  )
}
```

This will enable the use of the Bootstrap 5 color palette in ggplot2,
with options for reverse ordering and adjusting transparency levels.
To use these scales, simply add them to a ggplot object with the
respective `scale_color_bootstrap5()` or `scale_fill_bootstrap5()` function.

This custom implementation takes inspiration from the structure and methodology
observed in the `ggsci` package, tailored for the Bootstrap 5 palette and
additional features like reversing the order and customizing transparency.

Remember to check out the [pkglite vignettes](https://merck.github.io/pkglite/articles/).
They covered defining file packing scope specifications, curating file collections,
and more details on the output text file format. I wanted to make it as easy as
possible to run bidirectional R packages to plain text file conversion workflows
at scale.
