As people said, [web design is 95% typography](https://ia.net/topics/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/).
Once upon a time, people who care about the typography of their website
define their font stack using CSS like this:

```css
font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode", "Lucida Grande", sans-serif;
```

They secretly wish their website could look different from the mortal
websites which use Times New Roman, Arial, or Georgia with the
[funny-looking numerals](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200805/bad_web_type_georgias_numerals.html).

Until one day, their sincerity impressed the god of typography,
who granted them a technology named
[web fonts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_typography#Web_fonts).
They can finally use their favorite fonts on the web:

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Popular Sans';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url(https://server-address/popular-sans.woff2) format('woff2');
}

font-family: "Popular Sans", sans-serif;
```

With the blessing of some free web font services, people do not
worry if their website will look different across devices anymore.

Time flies, they eventually realized that many of the available free
web fonts are only designed with "acceptable" quality, while the high-quality
fonts like [Lato](http://www.latofonts.com/), are overused way too much.
In the same time, some commercial web font services who have
high-qualify fonts, are often utterly expensive with a ridiculous
subscription model.

Some other people decided to serve their own web fonts with CDN.
They encountered issues with names they never heard before, such as
[CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)
and [FOUT](https://github.com/typekit/webfontloader).
Readers from some regions of the world complained that
the content was loading slowly, even worse, the rendering
was sometimes entirely blocked since the CDN server was not reachable.

It's now 2018. The latest devices usually come with beautiful
system fonts. People rethought the core value of a good web font stack:
the fonts should 1. look beautiful, and 2. feel performant.
As a trade-off, the website does not need always to look the
same across all devices, not necessarily. The
[new system font stack](https://bitsofco.de/the-new-system-font-stack/)
thus returns. It looks like this:

```css
font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, "Segoe UI", Roboto, "Helvetica Neue", Arial, sans-serif;
```

It loads fast --- there is no more external asset loading required.
It looks beautiful and renders well on every mainstream operating system.
The recently released Bootstrap 4 selected such a
[native font stack](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/reboot/#native-font-stack).
I have also just [updated](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-tanka/commit/7bc79daa9ac1071908b3cc0d42863bf4fa3f1e04)
my blog theme [hugo-tanka](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-tanka)
with this font stack, hoping it could bring better reading experience.

Will the web typography technology evolve again in the next few years? Maybe.
Will people change their font stack to the trending one again?
Yes, we will probably often do that. Because we enjoy change, we really do.
