  A redesign of this site's Hugo theme, migrating from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS.
  The real work was figuring out what the site wanted to feel like.
---

Over the weekend, I gave this site a new look.
The [Hugo theme](https://github.com/nanxstats/hugo-nanx2026) has been
migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS, but honestly,
the framework change was the least interesting part.
The interesting part was the excuse it gave me to rethink what
a personal site should feel like in the age of intelligence abundance.

## What do I want the site to feel like?

The concept of "look and feel" sounds simple but can be too subtle to describe
accurately. You know good design when you see it, but describing _why_
it works is difficult.
When I asked Gemini to characterize the aesthetic I was searching for,
it offered the phrase **Intellectual Minimalism**, and I thought:
yes, that's exactly it.

The previous version of this site was minimal, but in an accidental way.
It was minimal the way a blank wall is minimal and information was
arranged on the page through a path of least resistance.
What I wanted instead was the kind of minimalism you find in a
[Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) layout or the
research blog of a frontier AI lab: every element present for a reason,
nothing competing for your attention (all you need), and a quiet sense of care
in the negative space.

## Typography, same but better

The single biggest design decision was the typography.
I chose to inherit the same typefaces from before, but with better
layout and more deliberate use of size, weight, and color to establish
information hierarchy.

The body text is set in a classical serif
([Martina Plantijn](https://klim.co.nz/fonts/martina-plantijn/)) that gives the
prose a warm, editorial quality for reading. Headings and navigation use a
neo-grotesque sans-serif with tight letter spacing, which creates just enough
contrast with the body text to establish hierarchy without shouting.
Code gets its own custom monospace typeface with coding ligatures.

## Whitespace as active design

The color palette is deliberately constrained: off-white paper,
near-black ink, a scale of zinc grays for secondary elements, and
crimson for links and interactive touches.

One famous opinion from Tufte is that white space is not the absence of design.
It is the design. The center content column is now capped at 65 characters,
which is the typographic sweet spot for comfortable reading with generous
margins on both sides.
The vertical spacing is similarly deliberate.
Sections now have enough space between them that your eye can rest,
but not so much that the page feels empty.

## Evolving agentic AI coding tools

Since this was a visual refactoring task, I used Google Antigravity and
Gemini to make it happen. The browser extension lets the model see what is
rendered in the browser and verify changes autonomously, which closes the
loop that [we had to close manually](/blog/post/claude-code-vibe-refactor/)
just last summer.
The tools have gotten remarkably good at the _how_.
The _what_ and the _why_ are still on us (for now).

## Beige forever

I started this redesign thinking it would take a few hours.
It took a weekend. It was because I kept fiddling with the
shade of off-white.

I guess we will never run out of beige!
