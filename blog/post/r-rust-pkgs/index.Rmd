  r-rust-pkgs is a curated GitHub repository that collects R packages
  on CRAN that use Rust. It provides a centralized resource for finding
  high-performance R packages built with Rust, leveraging Rust's strong
  ecosystem and memory safety features.

TL;DR: I'm curating a list of CRAN R packages that use Rust:

## Rust in R packages

Rust has been the [most admired programming
language](https://github.blog/developer-skills/programming-languages-and-frameworks/why-rust-is-the-most-admired-language-among-developers/)
for nearly a decade.
CRAN, the largest public repository for R packages,
has also [supported integrating Rust in R packages](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/using_rust.html) for several years. What's the magic behind the language?

To me, Rust is a great choice for writing high-performance extensions for
both R and Python, offering memory safety and a strong ecosystem.
Python has maturin and pyo3, while R benefits from
[rextendr](https://extendr.github.io/rextendr/), an R package that simplifies
scaffolding and interfacing with Rust.
All of these came from [outstanding community
contributions](https://archive.r-consortium.org/blog/2023/07/06/r-consortium-funded-project-extendr-provides-rust-extensions-for-r)
that make writing Rust-powered R packages much easier.
For an introduction, I recommend checking out
[Josiah Parry's video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRm-Qq2_Ap0),
which perfectly explains the R + Rust development workflow.

## Why this list?

When learning a new programming language, I often study real-world package
examples to understand language-specific engineering best practices.
However, to my knowledge, there has not been a centralized way to find
R packages that use Rust. To address this, I created
[**nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs**](https://github.com/nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs),
a GitHub repository listing CRAN packages that contain Rust code
in alphabetical order.

The list is automatically generated by scanning CRAN package `DESCRIPTION`
files where `SystemRequirements` contains `Cargo` (the Rust package manager).
Currently, it includes 27 packages. To update the list, simply fork the repo,
render the `README.Rmd` file, and submit a pull request.
