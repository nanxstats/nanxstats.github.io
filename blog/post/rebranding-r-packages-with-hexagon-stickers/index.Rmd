![A new hex sticker wall of my R packages.](/image/hex-stickers-nanxiao.png)

I have built [a few R packages](https://nanx.me/software/) over the years.
I have always been adding some forms of an ad hoc logo to them, trying to
make a visual impression. As the portfolio size grows larger, I realized
that I would need a principled way to create the logos and refresh my
packages' look. Hexagon stickers seem to be an acceptable form
of logos that are [heavily used](https://github.com/search?q=hex+sticker)
by the R community. So I decided to give it a try.

Limited by the fact that I am not a professional graphic designer while still
trying to do it myself, I set two goals:

1. Show strong visual consistency across the board, but also display clear
hierarchy and variation.
1. Create any future stickers without thinking. Ideally, I should be able to
make a new sticker in under a minute.

Following these parameters, my plan looks like this:

- **Elements**. The sticker will be text-only and not contain any subplots.
- **Typography**. Use a consistent
[typeface](https://fuckyeahtypefacedesign.tumblr.com/post/42119630673/so-you-draw-fonts-anonymously-submitted) for the package names. Zilla Slab at weight 500 is my choice
as it has a sturdy feel and more details than a sans serif.
Adjust the size as needed.
- **Color**. Since trying to find any (new) color combinations that work well
will add extra work, I simplified things a bit. I use beige as the fill color,
with the text and the sticker border sharing the same color. This color is decided by
the category of the package and comes from a single color palette.
I selected a low-saturated color palette
[vintage card](https://color.adobe.com/Kopia-vintage-card-color-theme-11990015/)
to convey a mild, sophisticated message.

The rest is easy:

1. Write the R code. There might be a lack of convention on where to put the code.
I chose to use `inst/logo/logo.R` to match the image name.
1. Generate the hex sticker image. It is placed as `man/figures/logo.png`.
This follows the guidelines in
[Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Figures)
and makes roxygen2 and pkgdown happy.
1. Link the sticker in the `README.md` title. The wonderful `usethis::use_logo()`
helps this process when the logo is ready.

Finally, the R script for generating the hex stickers is quite simple, thanks to
the incredible authors of sysfonts, hexSticker, and magick.

```r
sysfonts::font_add_google("Zilla Slab", "pf", regular.wt = 500)

hexSticker::sticker(
  subplot = ~ plot.new(), s_x = 1, s_y = 1, s_width = 0.1, s_height = 0.1,
  package = "pkgname", p_x = 1, p_y = 1, p_size = 8, h_size = 1.2, p_family = "pf",
  p_color = "#3F8CCC", h_fill = "#FFF9F2", h_color = "#3F8CCC",
  dpi = 320, filename = "man/figures/logo.png"
)

magick::image_read("man/figures/logo.png")

rstudioapi::restartSession()
```

That's all, folks.
