Let's implement a "skeleton loader" for Shiny apps.
A typical animated skeleton loading screen looks like this:

Compared to the traditional loading screens provided by tools like
[waiter](https://github.com/JohnCoene/waiter),
the skeleton loading screen is a prominent way to show the app is currently
loading and can give users an idea of the incoming page structure.

We have to make a few decisions to build the skeleton loading screen.

- We can leverage the flexible
  [shiny-fcp-loader](https://github.com/nanxstats/shiny-fcp-loader)
  template described in our [previous post](https://nanx.me/blog/post/shiny-fcp-loader/)
  as the basis and only modify the loader code.
- It would be ideal to use the same frontend framework as we used in the app UI
  (Bootstrap 5) to construct the HTML part of this skeleton loader.
- I found an excellent
  [Bootstrap 5 loading skeleton example](https://codepen.io/taylorgorman/pen/GRojZwV)
  by Taylor Gorman for the CSS part. It uses minimal, pure CSS to stylize the
  HTML UI components as skeletons and apply animation effects.

Assembling the pieces is then quite simple.
The Shiny app template is available from
<https://github.com/nanxstats/shiny-loading-skeleton>.
You can preview the demo at <https://nanx.shinyapps.io/shiny-loading-skeleton/>.

Here are a few notes on how to experiment with the template.

- `app.R`
  - Comment out the `shinyjs::hide()` line to keep showing the loader.
    This is useful because you might need to preview the loader for
    a longer time before it matches the ideal appearance.
- `loader/loader.R`
  - Preview the UI components before they are stylized as skeletons
    by removing the `loading-skeleton` class from the `container-fluid`
    div of the loader.
  - Customize the loading skeleton using (almost) the same UI code
    used for the landing page of your Shiny app: perhaps with a different
    input ID or HTML constructed by `htmltools` calls.
  - Since the Shiny (or bslib) Bootstrap CSS is not fetched yet when the loader
    is rendered, we need to load our copy manually as a dependency
    so that the loader's HTML components are correctly positioned and stylized.
- `loader/loader.css`
  - Add more names to the `.loading-skeleton` selector to cover more
    component types.
  - In this template, we ported two rules from Shiny-specific component
    styles to ensure the loader components won't shift on screen after the
    Shiny CSS files are loaded.
