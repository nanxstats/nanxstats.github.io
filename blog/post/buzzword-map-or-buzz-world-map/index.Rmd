I don't always care about popular topics because they usually fade fast.
But when I do, here is a 2017 world interest map for deep learning,
artificial intelligence, and blockchain (courtesy of Google Trends,
where you can reproduce it).

![Figure: Google Trends --- comparing the search traffic in 2017.](/image/buzzword-map-google-trends-2017.png)

The dominant color shown in each region represents the most searched term there.
The question is, what does this map tell us --- everything, or nothing at all?
I guess people will have a variety of answers. :)
