  RStudio 2024.12.0 unconditionally adds a ProjectID field to .Rproj files,
  causing unwanted Git diffs and potential editing conflicts.
  This post explains the issue and provides an R script to automatically
  remove the field at R startup, keeping repositories clean.

> **Update** (2025-02-13): The issue still exists in RStudio 2024.12.1. The fix still applies.\
> **Update** (2025-03-05): The issue [has been fixed](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/15524#issuecomment-2701777606) in RStudio >= 2025.04.0+323.

## TL;DR: The fix

The following script detects newly added `ProjectID` lines in `.Rproj` files
using `git diff`. If detected, it removes the line and saves the modified
`.Rproj` file.

```r
# Remove ProjectID from .Rproj files if freshly added
local({
  xfun <- requireNamespace("xfun", quietly = TRUE)
  rproj_files <- list.files(pattern = "\\.Rproj$", full.names = TRUE)
  if (!xfun || length(rproj_files) == 0L) return(invisible(NULL))

  lapply(rproj_files, function(f) {
    diff_cmd <- system(paste("git diff --", shQuote(f)), intern = TRUE)
    diff_out <- tryCatch(diff_cmd, error = function(e) character(0))

    if (any(grepl("^\\+ProjectId: ", diff_out))) {
      dcf_old <- xfun::read_utf8(f)
      dcf_new <- dcf_old[!grepl("^ProjectId: ", dcf_old)]
      xfun::write_utf8(dcf_new, f)
    }
  })

  invisible(NULL)
})
```

To apply this fix, add the script to your project-specific `.Rprofile` or the
user-specific `~/.Rprofile`. It will execute on every
[R startup](https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/environments/r/managing-r.html).
The script has been tested with RStudio IDE 2024.12.0 on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Requirements of the script:

- The project must use Git for version control.
- `git` must be accessible from the command-line
  ([Windows how-to](https://github.com/nanxstats/r-windows-paths)).
- The [xfun](https://cran.r-project.org/package=xfun) package is installed
  for handling UTF-8 encoded files.

## The issue

In RStudio 2024.12.0, opening an R package or project automatically adds a
`ProjectID` field to the `.Rproj` file, as shown in the screenshot above.

This feature was introduced in
[rstudio/rstudio#15140](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/pull/15140).
It was designed to accurately map projects with their `.Rproj.user/`
directories, which can now be stored externally---outside of the project.

While this feature serves a clear purpose, the current implementation
introduces some unintended side effects. For example, it may create
[unnecessary diffs](https://forum.posit.co/t/use-for-projectid-in-rproj-file/196345)
in version control, with no clear lifecycle for the `ProjectID`.
Team members collolaborating with different RStudio versions might also
get [conflicting edits](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/issues/15524),
leading to additional version control noise.

## Long-term and short-term solutions

This behavior has been improved in
[rstudio/rstudio#15654](https://github.com/rstudio/rstudio/pull/15654),
where `ProjectID` is only added when external storage for `.Rproj.user/`
is required. However, until a fixed version is released, or if users are
stuck with RStudio 2024.12.0, a temporary user-space solution could be useful.

## Why this fix works

The modification to `.Rproj` files occurs in RStudio IDE logic before the
R process starts, meaning we cannot prevent the addition of `ProjectID`.
However, we can reliably detect the change via `git diff` and revert it
when R starts. The script provided at the beginning of this post
automates this process.
