I am pleased to introduce
[pkglite for Python](https://pharmaverse.github.io/py-pkglite/),
now available on PyPI.
pkglite for Python provides a minimalist framework for packing source packages
written in any programming language into a text file and restoring them to
their original directory structure. You can install it with:

```bash
pip install pkglite
```

For installation as a global command-line tool,
[use pipx](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/):

```bash
pipx install pkglite
```

## Context

Four years ago, we released the R package pkglite,
designed for bidirectional conversion of R packages.
The motivation behind pkglite for R, including its role in supporting eCTD
submissions, was summarized in our
[_Clinical Trials_ paper](https://nanx.me/blog/post/ectd-pkglite-paper/) [@zhao2023electronic].
We also explored its application in
[retrieval-augmented generation](https://nanx.me/blog/post/pkglite-llm-prompt/)
to provide code context to large language models.

pkglite for R has since been adopted in multiple real-world applications,
including the first two R Consortium open-source R submissions
([pilot 1](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/pilot1.html),
[pilot 2](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/pilot2.html)),
and sponsor-led submissions
([webinar 1](https://youtu.be/t33dS17QHuA?t=2776),
[webinar 2](https://youtu.be/BlJNILSoZlM?t=2468)).
It is also featured in the [pharmaverse end-to-end clinical reporting
packages](https://pharmaverse.org/e2eclinical/esub/).

The overwhelmingly positive feedback on the R package motivated me
to consider: what's next?

## Creating pkglite for Python

To address this, I asked myself a broader question: what do people need?
Many colleagues and collaborators of mine use Python and other languages daily.
Extending the capability to pack and exchange source packages written in their
language of choice into plain text felt like a natural progression.

This goal led to several key design updates in pkglite for Python:

- **Language-agnostic design**.
  To support any programming language, I replaced R-specific packing scope
  specifications with a `.pkgliteignore` configuration file,
  compliant with the gitignore format standard.

- **Command-line interface**.
  Alongside the Python API, pkglite for Python includes a CLI built with
  [Typer](https://github.com/fastapi/typer). This enables seamless integration
  into shell scripts and standard engineering workflows.

- **Optimized tooling**.
  File type recognition now relies on a content-based
  [zlib algorithm](https://nanx.me/blog/post/txtvsbin/),
  replacing file-extension-based methods.
  The packed file parser has been rewritten using finite state machines
  for improved maintainability.
  Additionally, UTF-8 encoding is enforced for all text files across platforms.

## Performance testing

pkglite for Python is developed with performance in mind. Using this
[`bench.sh`](bench.sh) script, I tested packing and unpacking an entire
Python project with the virtual environment, which offers a realistic mix
of text and binary files.

On an M2 MacBook Air (2022), packing the project generated a 1.1 GB text file
in 16 seconds:

```text
Packing...
Packing complete.
Output file size: 1.18 GB
Packing time: 16 seconds
Packing write speed: 76.04 MB/s
```

Unpacking from the file took only 8 seconds:

```text
Unpacking...
Unpacking complete.
Unpacking time: 8 seconds
Unpacking read speed: 152.09 MB/s
```

## Acknowledgements

I am deeply grateful to my original pkglite R package coauthors,
Keaven Anderson and Yilong Zhang, for their encouragement to explore new ideas.
My thanks also go to Ross Farrugia and the pharmaverse council for including
the package and providing GitHub hosting, plus everyone who kindly contributed
valuable time for code reviews and validations.
