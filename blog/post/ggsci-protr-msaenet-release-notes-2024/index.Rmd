Maintaining R packages can sometimes be a nontrivial time and effort commitment.
You can see many aspects of the package author's
responsibilities in the [Releasing to CRAN](https://r-pkgs.org/release.html)
chapter of the _R Packages_ book.
Henrik's [CRANhaven](https://www.cranhaven.org/) also helps me appreciate
the efforts made by both CRAN maintainers and package maintainers to
keep a consistent, high standard on software quality and integration in
a single, authentic repository.

As a regular old package maintainer, I currently maintain
[10 personal packages on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/checks/check_results_me_at_nanx.me.html),
mostly stemmed from previous research activities.
This Spring, I took some time to clean up the issues in half of them.
Most of the important improvements are documented in this post.

## ggsci 3.0.3

[ggsci](https://nanx.me/ggsci/) is a ggplot2 extension package
offering various color scales.
ggsci 3.0.2 and 3.0.3 resolved some compatibility issues with ggplot 3.5.0.
Specifically, ggplot2 3.5.0 deprecated the `scale_name` argument
in `discrete_scale()`. This will generate warning messages when users
call any color scale functions that did not remove this argument
when using ggplot2 >= 3.5.0:

```text
Warning message:
The `scale_name` argument of `discrete_scale()` is deprecated as of
ggplot2 3.5.0.
```

However, if we simply remove this argument in the color scale functions,
R will complain under ggplot2 < 3.5.0 because this was a required argument:

```text
Error in `discrete_scale()`:
! argument "scale_name" is missing, with no default
Backtrace:
 1. ggsci::scale_color_*()
 2. ggplot2::discrete_scale(...)
 3. ggplot2::ggproto(...)
 4. rlang::list2(...)
Execution halted
```

To maximize compatibility, instead of requiring a recent minimum ggplot2
version, I opted for a more cautious approach by
[detecting the installed ggplot2 version at runtime](https://github.com/nanxstats/ggsci/pull/30)
and use different `discrete_scale()` calls under each condition.
Along the way, I found the internal functions such as `is_installed()`
borrowed from the R package shiny effective in solving this
version detection problem.

## protr 1.7-1

[protr](https://nanx.me/protr/) is a package for protein sequence
feature engineering.

protr 1.7-1 brings `crossSetSim()` to feature parity
with `parSeqSim()`. First, it extends `crossSetSim()`
[added in protr 1.7-0](https://nanx.me/blog/post/protr-1-7-0/)
to further support splitting similarity computation into batches
and showing computation progress.
It also implements a new function `crossSetSimDisk()` to offload the
intermediate results from each batch to disk and merge them in the end,
similar to the logic in `parSeqSimDisk()`.

These enhancements might help scale your similarity computation between
protein sequence sets when being bounded by available RAM size, due to
the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ or $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ space complexity.
However, specific situations could need further custom optimizations.
Of course, there is no shame in using high-memory machines
as a simple solution.

## msaenet 3.1.1

[msaenet](https://nanx.me/msaenet/) helps people explore
the solution space of adaptive estimations when building sparse linear models,
by supporting arbitrary numbers of adaptive estimation steps,
initialization methods, and automatic parameter tuning. In a previous post,
we showed how it can generate parsimonious solutions when modeling the
[sparse index tracking](https://nanx.me/blog/post/sparse-index-tracking/)
problem.

msaenet 3.1.1 resolves some `R CMD check` notes and example warnings
accumulated from R version updates and dependency updates.
It improves code style and now uses proper three-number semantic versioning.

## Where do we go from here?

I believe that proper delegation and transition of maintainership
is critical for the long-term health and sustainability of open source projects.
I have tried a few times in the past years to find new maintainers for
my packages---if you are interested in taking some responsibilities,
please reach out.
