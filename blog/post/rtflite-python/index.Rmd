It is my pleasure to introduce [rtflite](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/),
a new Python package for generating RTF documents.
A preview version is now available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/rtflite/).
You can install it with:

```bash
pip install rtflite
```

The ultimate goal of rtflite is to provide a lightweight solution for
generating production-ready tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) in RTF format.
Its interface is designed to be similar to the R package r2rtf,
with more rigorous data validations driven by
[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) and type annotations.

## Background

Early in my career in the pharmaceutical industry, I quickly realized the
substantial workload involved in late-stage clinical trials, particularly
for global regulatory submissions spanning multiple studies.
Efficient tools and workflows are essential for timely eCTD submissions
after database lock.

Many trial statisticians use R for clinical study report (CSR) verification,
often developing reusable functions and packages to improve efficiency.
A key turning point for me was when [Keaven](https://keaven.github.io/) asked
me a simple yet insightful question: What is missing to make R viable for
clinical study reports and regulatory submission?
That same year, the [R/Pharma conference](https://rinpharma.com/event/rinpharma2018/)
was launched to explore open-source solutions.

[Nan](https://nanx.me/) and I believed any sustainable solution must
integrate seamlessly into existing, well-established workflows.
With that principle in mind, we developed two essential R packages:
r2rtf for reporting and pkglite for eCTD submission.
We documented our approach in the
[_R for Clinical Study Reports and Submission_](https://r4csr.org) (R4CSR)
book and contributed to the R Consortium R Submission Working Group's
[first R submission pilot](https://rconsortium.github.io/submissions-wg/pilot1.html)
to the US FDA.

After joining Meta, I was encouraged by my colleagues to learn Python.
With Nan's parallel work on
[pkglite for Python](https://nanx.me/blog/post/pkglite-python/),
it was a natural step for me to explore Python-based solutions for clinical
study reporting and submission---continuing our open-source efforts
in a new ecosystem.

## Example

Below is an [example](https://pharmaverse.github.io/rtflite/articles/example-baseline/)
demonstrating how rtflite can be used to generate a baseline characteristics
table in RTF format, similar to r2rtf:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.content .markdown pre.python code {
  font-size: 0.78125rem;
}
```

```python
from importlib.resources import files

import pandas as pd

import rtflite as rtf

data_path = files("rtflite.data").joinpath("baseline.csv")
df = pd.read_csv(data_path, na_filter=False)

header1 = pd.DataFrame([["", "Placebo", "Drug Low Dose", "Drug High Dose", "Total"]])
header2 = pd.DataFrame([["", "n", "(%)", "n", "(%)", "n", "(%)", "n", "(%)"]])

doc = rtf.RTFDocument(
    df=df,
    rtf_title=rtf.RTFTitle(
        text=["Demographic and Anthropometric Characteristics", "ITT Subjects"]
    ),
    rtf_column_header=[
        rtf.RTFColumnHeader(df=header1, col_rel_width=[3] + [2] * 4),
        rtf.RTFColumnHeader(
            df=header2,
            col_rel_width=[3] + [1.2, 0.8] * 4,
            border_top=[""] + ["single"] * 8,
            border_left=["single"] + ["single", ""] * 4,
        ),
    ],
    rtf_body=rtf.RTFBody(
        page_by=["var_label"],
        col_rel_width=[3] + [1.2, 0.8] * 4 + [3],
        text_justification=["l"] + ["c"] * 8 + ["l"],
        text_format=[""] * 9 + ["b"],
        border_left=["single"] + ["single", ""] * 4 + ["single"],
        border_top=[""] * 9 + ["single"],
        border_bottom=[""] * 9 + ["single"],
    ),
)

doc.write_rtf("output.rtf")

converter = rtf.LibreOfficeConverter()
converter.convert(
    input_files="output.rtf", output_dir=".", format="pdf", overwrite=True
)
```

## Roadmap

Development of rtflite is structured into three phases:

- **Phase 1**: Support for single-page TLF generation (80% completed in v0.1.0).
- **Phase 2**: Implementation of pagination algorithms and features.
- **Phase 3**: Reproduction of all examples from the [R4CSR book](https://r4csr.org).

Beyond phase 3, we plan to showcase rtflite alongside pkglite for eCTD
submissions in Python, replicating the success of the R submission pilots.
We hope this work will contribute to the growing adoption of open-source
solutions for regulatory-compliant analysis, reporting, and submission
in drug and medical device development.

## Acknowledgements

We extend our gratitude to Ross Farrugia, the pharmaverse council,
and the pharmaverse community for their support in GitHub hosting and
incorporating rtflite into the pharmaverse ecosystem.

```{js, echo=FALSE}
// Check and reset scroll position if page has been auto-scrolled to embed
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
  let checkCount = 0;
  const maxChecks = 100;

  const checkScrollPosition = function () {
    if (window.scrollY > 0) {
      window.scrollTo(0, 0);
      return;
    }

    checkCount++;
    if (checkCount < maxChecks) {
      setTimeout(checkScrollPosition, 10);
    }
  };

  setTimeout(checkScrollPosition, 10);
});
```
