I once read a joke with some dry humor a long time ago. It's almost a parable about how the system amplifies fragility. I'm not entirely sure where it originated, but here you go:

> A bunny bounced into a bakery and asked the baker: "do you have 100 croissants?"
> 
> The baker: "Ahh, I'm so sorry we don't have that many."
> 
> The bunny: "Oh... okay." The bunny left disappointed.
> 
> On the second day, the bunny bounced into the bakery: "do you have 100 croissants?"
> 
> The baker: "I'm sorry we still don't have that..."
> 
> The bunny left disappointed again.
> 
> On the third day, the bunny bounced into the bakery: do you have 100 croissants?
> 
> The baker: "Yes! Yes! We've got 100 croissants today!"
> 
> The bunny: "That's perfect! I'll take two."

Bill Gates may [think](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Capitalism-Without-Capital) that the supply and demand model doesn't apply to software. I neither agree or disagree. Historically, the burst of the dot-com bubble left us some infrastructure of the high-speed Internet. The subprime mortgage crisis left some cheap houses. I cannot say for sure what will be left when a crisis happens to the "blockchain" or "AI" industries. Although there could be a lot of Mac computers, Dell monitors, and Python code.
