Previously on link checking… We discussed the link rot issue before. We also built a simple link checker for blogdown projects based on the XML sitemap generated by Hugo. In reality, I maintain many more bookdown projects and Quarto projects than blogdown projects. Searching site: bookdown::bookdown_sitealso shows that there are 10,000+ bookdown projects hosted on GitHub alone.</description>

The Problem The distill (formerly radix) package offers an excellent option in the R Markdown ecosystem to create beautifully typed websites. I was using it one day and looking into customizing the syntax highlighting theme. Then I found this issue:
I was a bit surprised and sad that there is no easy way to customize it.</description>
