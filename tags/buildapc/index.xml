      <description>In 2018, I built a PC to train models with GPU. Besides the GPU, the machine has a 6-core (12 threads) CPU and 32GB of RAM. The hardware was nothing fancy compared to a lot of deep learning builds but gets the job done.
Recently, I experienced an issue that probably all R users experienced: running out of memory. Not for training neural networks, but for training some more traditional statistical learning models.</description>

      <description>Five years ago, GNOME 3’s immaturity was one of the reasons for me to switch to a Mac. After finished watching two seasons of Mr. Robot, I somehow missed it. With my AWS/GCP bills going up quite a bit recently, I quickly decided to invest a little and build a PC to retry the Linux desktop environment, also, to tackle some personal machine learning projects.
Hardware Here is my PCPartPicker part list for the parts of choice.</description>
