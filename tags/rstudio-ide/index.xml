      <description>Skating at Venice Beach, Los Angeles. Photo by Josh Hild. Starting with RStudio IDE version 2024.12.0+467, a redesigned splash screen replaces the previous app logo. This change was introduced in rstudio/rstudio#15347 and it looks like this:&#xA;New splash screen design in RStudio IDE 2024.12+. While visually polished, the new splash screen feels slightly too shiny (no pun intended) and adds a delay to the perceived time before I can first interact with the UI.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I published my first VS Code extension/theme on Visual Studio Marketplace, with the source hosted on GitHub. Try it out today.&#xA;A screenshot for editing R Markdown documents with the theme. Syntax highlighting provided by vscode-R. Captured with IBM Plex Mono at 18px.&#xA;It was not until late in my life that I realized my eyes were sensitive to the visual aesthetics of things. To make things worse, I care about them very much, at least in the name of productivity and inspiration.</description>
