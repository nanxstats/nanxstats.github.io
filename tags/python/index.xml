      <description>A flamingo peeking through the plants. National Aviary, Pittsburgh, PA. Photo by Adam Custer. I attended PyCon US 2025 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania from May 16–18, 2025. As my first Python conference, I wanted to document the most interesting things I learned.&#xA;Why a statistician goes to PyCon? It might seem odd for a statistician to focus on any particular programming language. But I’m not your typical statistician. As Dijkstra said:</description>

      <description>Touring in the clouds. Photo by Clement Delhaye. This is a guest post generously contributed by Yilong Zhang, a biostatistician at Meta.&#xA;It is my pleasure to introduce rtflite, a new Python package for generating RTF documents. A preview version is now available on PyPI. You can install it with:&#xA;pip install rtflite The ultimate goal of rtflite is to provide a lightweight solution for generating production-ready tables, listings, and figures (TLFs) in RTF format.</description>

      <description>Les Menuires, France. Photo by Yann Allegre. I am pleased to introduce pkglite for Python, now available on PyPI. pkglite for Python provides a minimalist framework for packing source packages written in any programming language into a text file and restoring them to their original directory structure. You can install it with:&#xA;pip install pkglite For installation as a global command-line tool, use pipx:&#xA;pipx install pkglite Context Four years ago, we released the R package pkglite, designed for bidirectional conversion of R packages.</description>

      <description>Hummingbirds. Photo by Zdeněk Macháček. I’m delighted to announce my second Python package, tinyvdiff, now available on PyPI. It offers a lightweight pytest plugin for detecting appearance changes in visual content, such as figures or documents. You can install it with:&#xA;pip install tinyvdiff Setup and usage Here is an example test for matplotlib graphics, from the tinyvdiff demo project:&#xA;import pytest from tinyvdiff_demo.matplotlib import generate_plot @pytest.fixture def temp_pdf(tmp_path): &amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Fixture to create a temporary PDF file path&amp;quot;&amp;quot;&amp;quot; return tmp_path / &amp;quot;test.</description>

      <description>Downhill mountain biking. Photo by Tim Foster. I’m excited to share that my first Python package, tinytopics, is now available on PyPI. You can install it using&#xA;pip install tinytopics tinytopics is a minimalist solution designed to scale up topic modeling tasks on CPUs and GPUs using PyTorch.&#xA;Motivation Fitting topic models at scale using classical algorithms on CPUs can be slow. Carbonetto et al. (2022) demonstrated the equivalence between Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) and multinomial topic model likelihoods.</description>

      <description>Many outstanding researchers and labs have created visualizations of their research using word clouds. In this post, I present a simple, automated “paper2wordcloud” workflow to create eye-catching word cloud visualizations. It combines the efficiency of automation with the power of human intuition and aesthetic sense. The figure below was created using my published papers.&#xA;A word cloud visualization generated for my papers using this workflow. The general steps in the workflow are:</description>

      <description>I constantly feel lucky to witness the growth of the R web framework, Shiny, in the past ten years. In his keynote speech at rstudio::conf 2022, Joe Cheng shared an excellent summary of Shiny’s achievements and exciting outlook.&#xA;I am deeply moved by the story about how Shiny was created and Joe’s journey, and I recommend you watch the talk recording below if you haven’t. Notably, after Hadley’s Mastering Shiny book, the community-maintained awesome list awesome-shiny-extensions was again highlighted in Joe’s talk from 24:00 to 24:33 (thanks so much for the shout-out!</description>
