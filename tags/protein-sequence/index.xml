      <description>Cute market in Rome, Italy. Photo by Mark Pecar. Maintaining R packages can sometimes be a nontrivial time and effort commitment. You can see many aspects of the package author’s responsibilities in the Releasing to CRAN chapter of the R Packages book. Henrik’s CRANhaven also helps me appreciate the efforts made by both CRAN maintainers and package maintainers to keep a consistent, high standard on software quality and integration in a single, authentic repository.</description>

      <description>3D render from Google DeepMind. Artist: Wes Cockx. I am glad to announce the release of protr 1.7-0. Install it from CRAN with:&#xA;install.packages(&amp;quot;protr&amp;quot;) You can also install it from conda-forge in Python.&#xA;First released in 2012, protr was my very first open source R package. The package generates representations for protein sequences such as numerical features and similarity measures. Since its inception, protr has evolved after 21 CRAN releases by incorporating user feedback.</description>
