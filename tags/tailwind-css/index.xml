      <description>Over the weekend, I gave this site a new look. The Hugo theme has been migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS, but honestly, the framework change was the least interesting part. The interesting part was the excuse it gave me to rethink what a personal site should feel like in the age of intelligence abundance.&#xA;A wall with dried flowers and a straw hat.

      <description>Desk setup with plants. Photo by Amari James. In January 2023, I built a basic, interactive deep learning GPU selector app inspired by Tim Dettmers’ popular guide. The original project was a pure HTML + JavaScript + CSS “vibe coding” experiment, driven by chat with GPT-3.5, which was the SOTA at the time. While the core logic worked, I did not focus much on its UI or UX.&#xA;Now, two and a half years later, I wanted to see how far agentic coding assistants have come, by refactoring the app with modern tools and design sensibilities.</description>

      <description>Villa in Zurich, perspective view. From “Moderne Architektur” (Modern Architecture), edited by Lambert &amp;amp; Stahl, Stuttgart, 1891. Scan from Europeana. I am delighted to announce the release of ggsci 3.2.0. The R package ggsci was first released in 2016. It offers a range of ggplot2 color scales drawn from various sources, including scientific publications, data visualization tools, sci-fi movies, and television series.&#xA;To install ggsci from CRAN, use:&#xA;install.packages(&amp;quot;ggsci&amp;quot;) As a follow-up to the ggsci 3.</description>
