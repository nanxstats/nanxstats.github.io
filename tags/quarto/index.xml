      <description>Rubber duck debugging. Photo by Timothy Dykes. If Google leads you here, you probably assigned a character value to a knitr chunk option such as fig.width or fig.height that only accepts numeric values, and your are trying to render that R Markdown or Quarto document.
For example, it is easy to make this mistake:
```{r, fig.width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;} plot(1:10) ``` where you probably meant:
```{r, fig.width=6, out.width=&amp;quot;100%&amp;quot;} plot(1:10) ``` That’s all! I hope this helps.</description>

      <description>Majesty Palm. Photo by Kara Eads. Introduction There are more than 1,500 open source font families available on Google Fonts, presenting designers and developers with an extensive, yet often overwhelming, array of options. With such a vast selection, it can be challenging to sift through and find the perfect typeface for your projects, let alone remember the hidden gems you may have come across in the past.
To address this challenge, I started Open Source Typography, an opinionated, curated lookbook of outstanding open source fonts.</description>

      <title>Bolden Your Typography in R Markdown and Quarto with MLModern</title>
      <link>https://nanx.me/blog/post/mlmodern/</link>

      <description>A visual comparison between Latin Modern (blue) and MLModern (red) at the same size. You probably have created PDF documents using R Markdown or Quarto. The default look and feel of these documents are driven by the default typeface, Computer Modern, or its extended implementation, Latin Modern.
To me, these default typefaces work fine, but they could be “thicker” to be more legible on HiDPI and Retina displays. MLModern offers such a sturdy rendition of the Computer Modern design.</description>

Previously on link checking… We discussed the link rot issue before. We also built a simple link checker for blogdown projects based on the XML sitemap generated by Hugo. In reality, I maintain many more bookdown projects and Quarto projects than blogdown projects. Searching site: bookdown::bookdown_sitealso shows that there are 10,000+ bookdown projects hosted on GitHub alone.</description>
