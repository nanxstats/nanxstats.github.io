I’m excited to announce revdeprun 2.1.0, a major update to my Rust CLI tool for automating R package reverse dependency checks. This release is really two updates in one: version 2.0.0 accelerated dependency installation, while 2.1.0 addressed two more bottlenecks I discovered during testing. The combined result is a much faster workflow from start to finish.</description>

      <description>I’ve created a ligaturized version of DM Mono by adding Fira Code ligatures. You can download it from GitHub: https://github.com/nanxstats/dm-mono-ligaturized.&#xA;Ligaturized DM Mono in action: Running Homebrew in Ghostty. Theme: Dracula+. Why ligatures? I’ll confess: I can’t start real work until I’ve found a coding font that fits the vibe of the day. My dotfiles are fairly basic, but they include an extensive list of free and commercial monospaced fonts that I rotate through regularly.</description>

      <description>Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park. Photo by Elvis Liang. A week ago, I announced revdeprun, a Rust CLI tool for automating R package reverse dependency checks. Since then, I have been iterating rapidly: 16 crates.io releases in a week! These updates focused on both correctness and speed. The tool has evolved from its initial v0.1.0 to v1.4.2, and the workflow now leverages pak for dependency resolution and xfun for the checking1.</description>

      <description>Smoke and speed: a race car mid-drift on the track. Photo by Jack Stapleton. Update (2025-10-31): revdeprun 1.0.0 switched to using a custom workflow to pre-install binary dependencies for checking reverse dependencies, and run parallel checks using xfun::rev_check(). This significantly improves performance and reliability. Read the release notes here. This post has been updated to reflect these changes.&#xA;I’m glad to announce the release of revdeprun, a Rust CLI tool that makes it easy to run reverse dependency checks on cloud instances1.</description>
