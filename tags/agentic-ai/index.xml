      <description>Over the weekend, I gave this site a new look. The Hugo theme has been migrated from Bootstrap to Tailwind CSS, but honestly, the framework change was the least interesting part.

The original project was a pure HTML + JavaScript + CSS “vibe coding” experiment, driven by chat with GPT-3.5, which was the SOTA at the time. While the core logic worked, I did not focus much on its UI or UX.&#xA;Now, two and a half years later, I wanted to see how far agentic coding assistants have come, by refactoring the app with modern tools and design sensibilities.</description>
