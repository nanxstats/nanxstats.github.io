      <description>Monument Valley Navajo Tribal Park, Saint Michaels, United States. Photo by Elvis Liang. A week ago, I announced revdeprun, a Rust CLI tool for automating R package reverse dependency checks. Since then, I have been iterating rapidly: 16 crates.io releases in a week! These updates focused on both correctness and speed. The tool has evolved from its initial v0.1.0 to v1.4.2, and the workflow now leverages pak for dependency resolution and xfun for the checking1.</description>

      <description>Smoke and speed: a race car mid-drift on the track. Photo by Jack Stapleton. Update (2025-10-31): revdeprun 1.0.0 switched to using a custom workflow to pre-install binary dependencies for checking reverse dependencies, and run parallel checks using xfun::rev_check(). This significantly improves performance and reliability. Read the release notes here. This post has been updated to reflect these changes.&#xA;I’m glad to announce the release of revdeprun, a Rust CLI tool that makes it easy to run reverse dependency checks on cloud instances1.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I’m curating a list of CRAN R packages that use Rust: nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs.&#xA;Dirt bike. Photo by POWERING OFFROAD. Rust in R packages Rust has been the most admired programming language for nearly a decade. CRAN, the largest public repository for R packages, has also supported integrating Rust in R packages for several years. What’s the magic behind the language?&#xA;To me, Rust is a great choice for writing high-performance extensions for both R and Python, offering memory safety and a strong ecosystem.</description>
