      <description>A cylinder casting a circular and rectangular shadow on two perpendicular planes, showing how perspective shapes interpretation of a single form. 3D render by Daniels Joffe. Since its open source release in 2017, Inter has become a widely adopted sans-serif font, especially popular for web content and user interfaces that benefit from a clean, neo-grotesque style. Thoughtful glyph redesigns in versions 4.0 and 4.1 (released since 2023) have further enhanced its technical maturity and visual appeal.</description>

      <link>https://nanx.me/blog/post/r-readability-parser/</link>

      <description>The R and JavaScript code to reproduce the results in this post is available from https://github.com/nanxstats/r-readability-parser.&#xA;Photo by Nick Hillier. Update (2023-09-04): Browserify support was removed in jsdom v22.0.0. This post has been updated to recommend installing jsdom v20.0.0 to ensure the code examples work as intended. The original versions of JS libraries in the GitHub repo remain unchanged, as they continue to function correctly.&#xA;Readability.js Maybe you have used tools like rvest to harvest text data from web pages.</description>
