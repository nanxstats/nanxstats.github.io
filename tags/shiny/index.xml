      <description>After procrastinating for some time, I finally set up a dedicated self-hosting server, nanx.app, for my public shiny apps. From now on, most of the web applications listed on my software page will be available from two mirrors — the self-hosting server and the public cloud hosting solution shinyapps.io kindly provided by RStudio.
A collection of my shiny apps, now also self-hosted.
 The Motivation I have built many shiny apps over the years — a few of them are public and open source.</description>

  TL;DR: here is a curated list of R packages that offer extended UI or server components for Shiny: nanxstats/awesome-shiny-extensions. Pull requests welcomed!
 Five years ago, I wrote my first research software paper, and it eventually got published in Bioinformatics. If you know me, it’s probably not surprising that the paper was about an R package and a companion Shiny app.</description>

      <title>Shiny Now Supports Async Execution</title>

      <description>Shiny is my favorite web application framework. It is simply awesome. Shiny 1.1.0 was released to CRAN last week. This update brings probably the most significant feature/improvement in recent years: async execution support. With the help of future, promises (computer science people surely knew how to name abstract things…), and this shiny update, you can now write scalable web applications using Shiny.
You Want It When? (Zootopia)
  In brief, if you have some long-running computations (such as querying a remote database, live fitting a statistical model) in your Shiny app, that computation would block additional users to use the app simultaneously, until that computation is finished.</description>
