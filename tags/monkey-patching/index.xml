      <description>A race car pit crew in action during a pit stop. Photo by Paul Krüger. I’m excited to announce revdeprun 2.1.0, a major update to my Rust CLI tool for automating R package reverse dependency checks. This release is really two updates in one: version 2.0.0 accelerated dependency installation, while 2.1.0 addressed two more bottlenecks I discovered during testing. The combined result is a much faster workflow from start to finish.</description>

      <title>pkgdown.offline: Build pkgdown websites without an internet connection</title>

      <description>On the grid but off the line. Logo font: Founders Grotesk Condensed Semibold. I’m pleased to announce that the R package pkgdown.offline is now available on CRAN. You can install it with:&#xA;install.packages(&amp;quot;pkgdown.offline&amp;quot;) pkgdown.offline enables you to build pkgdown websites in environments without internet access, such as private, restricted development workflows or CI/CD pipelines. It achieves this by bundling the essential frontend assets (CSS, JavaScript) that pkgdown typically fetches online and by providing alternative implementations for key pkgdown functions like init_site() and build_site().</description>

      <title>Customize testthat snapshot directory with monkey patching</title>

      <description>Memories instant photo. Photo by Kelly Sikkema. Problem Snapshot testing has been supported in testthat since testthat 3.0.0. By default, snapshot files are saved to a hardcoded directory:&#xA;tests/testthat/_snaps/ Unfortunately, testthat does not provide a public API to customize this directory. This question has been raised in issues like r-lib/testthat#1623, suggesting that customizing the snapshot directory is a valid use case.&#xA;Solution Without a public API, the most practical solution is to modify testthat’s internal behavior at runtime through monkey patching.</description>
