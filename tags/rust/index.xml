      <description>Smoke and speed: a race car mid-drift on the track. Photo by Jack Stapleton. Update (2025-10-31): revdeprun 1.0.0 switched to using a custom workflow to pre-install binary dependencies for checking reverse dependencies, and run parallel checks using xfun::rev_check(). This improvement significantly improves performance and reliability. Read the release notes here. This post has been updated to reflect these changes.&#xA;I’m glad to announce the release of revdeprun, a Rust CLI tool that makes it easy to run reverse dependency checks on cloud instances1.</description>

      <description>TL;DR: I’m curating a list of CRAN R packages that use Rust: nanxstats/r-rust-pkgs.&#xA;Dirt bike. Photo by POWERING OFFROAD. Rust in R packages Rust has been the most admired programming language for nearly a decade. CRAN, the largest public repository for R packages, has also supported integrating Rust in R packages for several years. What’s the magic behind the language?&#xA;To me, Rust is a great choice for writing high-performance extensions for both R and Python, offering memory safety and a strong ecosystem.</description>
