I’m pleased to announce that msaenet 3.1.2 is now available on CRAN.&#xA;You can install msaenet with:&#xA;install.packages(&amp;quot;msaenet&amp;quot;) If you frequently build sparse linear models, msaenet can help you generate more parsimonious solutions with adaptive estimations.

The Releasing to CRAN chapter of the R Packages book provides an excellent overview of the many responsibilities package authors face. Henrik’s CRANhaven also helps me appreciate the efforts made by both CRAN maintainers and package maintainers to keep a consistent, high standard on software quality and integration within a single, trusted repository.</description>
