      <description>Like cameras, online trackers are everywhere. Photo by Matthew Henry.
What happened After using it (or being used) for about ten years, today I consciously removed the Google Analytics tracking code from all the personal websites I control, including this blogdown (Hugo) site, the pkgdown sites for my R packages, and my Shiny apps. I never felt better, as from now on, people are browsing my websites tracking-free.
Why I did it I think the blog posts by the pioneers who realized this before explained the economic reasons pretty well.</description>
