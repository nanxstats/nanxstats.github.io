      <description>Les Menuires, France. Photo by Yann Allegre. I am pleased to introduce pkglite for Python, now available on PyPI. pkglite for Python provides a minimalist framework for packing source packages written in any programming language into a text file and restoring them to their original directory structure. You can install it with:&#xA;pip install pkglite For installation as a global command-line tool, use pipx:&#xA;pipx install pkglite Context Four years ago, we released the R package pkglite, designed for bidirectional conversion of R packages.</description>

      <description>Photo by Estée Janssens. I’m delighted to share that our paper, Some Group Sequential Trials From Industry Over the Last 30 Years, has been published in Statistics in Biopharmaceutical Research.&#xA;You can download the accepted manuscript (PDF, 457 KB) here.&#xA;Key takeaways The paper began as a conference talk presented by Keaven, our lead author, in 2022. Recognizing the value of these stories, we decided to develop them into a full-length paper.</description>

      <description>I feel super honored to say that I have received the 2018 John M. Chambers Statistical Software Award from the American Statistical Association this year, for my R package liftr on reproducible research. This year’s award also has another recipient: Dustin Tran, for his excellent Python library Edward on probabilistic programming. We just had a great session of invited talks today at the 2018 Joint Statistical Meetings in Vancouver, Canada.</description>
