      <description>Safari 14 introduced a new UI component that I cannot love more: a privacy report detailing all the third-party trackers blocked by WebKit’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP).

      <description>I used to mention creating a purely R-based static website generator named Haiku with my then classmate Arjun about two years ago. I remember that he said the name was nice.
