One housekeeping task I have always wanted to automate with R is scanning the entire website to ensure that all the links are still working. It is essential for maintaining an enjoyable reading experience without archiving too many external links.
Conceptually, the requirement for a generic broken link checker is quite simple:</description>

      <description>Safari 14 introduced a new UI component that I cannot love more: a privacy report detailing all the third-party trackers blocked by WebKit’s Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP). Following this progress and removing Google Analytics last year, I decide to finish my part today by purging Disqus (comes with unsolicited tracking) from this website.

      <description>I used to mention creating a purely R-based static website generator named Haiku with my then classmate Arjun about two years ago. I remember that he said the name was nice.
