      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Regression and variable selection in high-dimensional settings,
      especially when p >> n has been a popular research topic in statistical machine learning.
      In recent years, many successful methods have been developed to tackle this problem.
      In this paper, we propose the multi-step adaptive elastic-net (MSA-Enet), a multi-step
      estimation algorithm built upon adaptive elastic-net regularization. The numerical study
      on simulation data and real-world biological datasets have shown that the MSA-Enet method
      tends to significantly reduce the number of false-positive variables, while still maintain
      the estimation accuracy. By analyzing the variables eliminated in each step, more insight
      could be gained about the structure of the correlated variable groups. These properties
      are desirable in many real-world variable selection and regression problems.

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Amino acid sequence-derived structural and physiochemical descriptors
      are extensively utilized for the research of structural, functional, expression and interaction
      profiles of proteins and peptides. We developed protr, a comprehensive R package for generating
      various numerical representation schemes of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequence.
      The package calculates eight descriptor groups composed of twenty two types of commonly used
      descriptors that include about 22,700 descriptor values. It allows users to select amino acid
      properties from the AAindex database, and use self-defined properties to construct customized
      descriptors. For proteochemometric modeling, it calculates six types of scales-based descriptors
      derived by various dimensionality reduction methods. The protr package also integrates the
      functionality of similarity score computation derived by protein sequence alignment and
      Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity measures within a list of proteins, and calculates
      profile-based protein features based on position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM).
      We also developed ProtrWeb, a user-friendly web server for calculating descriptors presented
      in the protr package.<br>
      The protr package is freely available from CRAN:

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> In chemoinformatics and bioinformatics fields, one of the main computational
      challenges in various predictive modeling is to find a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules
      under investigation such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions. To solve this problem,
      we developed a freely available R/Bioconductor package, called Compound-Protein Interaction with R (Rcpi),
      for complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more complex interactions including
      protein-protein and compound-protein interactions. Rcpi could calculate a large number of structural
      and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino acid sequences, molecular descriptors
      of small molecules from their topology, and protein-protein interaction and compound-protein interaction
      descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, Rcpi could also provide a number of useful auxiliary
      utilities to facilitate the user's need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could
      conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to solve various biological and drug
      research questions in computational biology and drug discovery. Rcpi is freely available from the Bioconductor
      site (<a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rcpi.html">http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/Rcpi.html</a>).

    <h5>Integrating Multiple Evidence Sources to Predict  Adverse Drug Reactions Based on Systems Pharmacology Model</h5>

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Identifying potential adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is critically important
      for drug discovery and public health. Previous computational methods in this domain have focused on either
      signal detection or utilizing a few drug information. Systems pharmacology models are urgently needed to
      combine various types of datasets for accurately predicting likely ADRs because of complex mechanisms
      underlying ADRs. Here we developed a multiple evidence fusion (MEF) method for the large-scale prediction
      of drug ADRs that can handle both approved drugs and novel molecules. MEF is based on the similarity
      reference by collaboration filtering, and integrates multiple similarity measures from each of their
      data types separately, taking advantage of the complementarity in the data. We used MEF to integrate
      drug-related and ADR-related data from multiple levels, the network structural data formed by known
      drug-ADR relationships for predicting likely unknown ADRs. On cross validation, it obtains high
      sensitivity and specificity (AUC = 0.96 and 0.91 for network features and node attributes, respectively),
      substantially outperforming existing methods that utilize single or a few data types. We validated our
      prediction by their overlap with drug-ADR associations that are known in databases. The proposed
      computational method could be used for a complementary hypothesis generation and rapid analysis of
      potential drug-ADR interactions.

    <h5><em>In silico</em> Evaluation of logD<sub>7.4</sub> and Comparison with Other Prediction Methods</h5>

      <strong>Abstract:</strong> Lipophilicity, evaluated by either n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logP)
      or n-octanol/buffer solution distribution coefficient (logD), is of high importance in pharmacology,
      toxicology and medicinal chemistry. A quantitative structure-property relationship (QSPR) study was
      carried out for the prediction of distribution coefficients at pH 7.4 (logD<sub>7.4</sub>) of a large data set
      consisting of 1,130 organic compounds with 30 molecular descriptors selected by genetic algorithm (GA).
      Partial least squares (PLS) and support vector machine (SVM) regression were used to build prediction
      models with 904 molecules as the training set, and the predictive ability was evaluated with 226 molecules
      as the external test set. The results exhibited by the regression statistics demonstrate that the SVM model
      is more reliable and has a better predictive accuracy than the PLS model. The square correlation coefficients
      of fitting, cross validation and prediction are 0.92, 0.90 and 0.90, respectively. The corresponding root
      mean square errors are 0.52, 0.59 and 0.56, respectively. The reliability and generalization ability of the
      model were assessed by applicability domain and Y-randomization test, and 30 selected molecular descriptors
      could give a reliable and direct interpretation to logD<sub>7.4</sub> to some extent. When compared with the
      logD<sub>7.4</sub> values calculated by five methods from Discovery Studio and ChemAxon, our SVM model shows
      superiority over them. The results indicate that our model is a reliable and promising method to
      evaluate logD<sub>7.4</sub>.
